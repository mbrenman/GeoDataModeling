README for File_Splitter
Matt Brenman
----------__________----------__________----------__________----------__________
Purpose:
        The File_Splitter is used to split a text file that contains a column
     header into multiple text files while keeping all data and formatting and 
     keeping the header in each file.

Use:
        The module requires a text input file (where the path can be a full path
     or the relative path from where the script resides. For each file created
     the user must supply a name for the file. If the full path is not given,
     the files will output to the directory which contains the script. If the 
     files names are already used in the output directory, they will be
     overwritten.

Purpose: 
        To allow for a user to insert a delimited text table (with any delimiter)
     and to either print out the uniqueness of each field (yes or no) or print 
     out all of the unique values of a each field. All operations can be done on 
     one or all fields, and the results are printed to a file provided by the user.
Use:
        This module needs an input file (with a text delimiter that can be 
     specified at runtime), and an output text file (which will be created if it
     does not exist before runtime).
        This module has two actions with unique fields. It can, 1) Print out a
     list of fields and whether they are unique, or 2) Print out all of the values
     for a field, without repeating a value.
        The user is also asked to choose a scope of the output. They can choose to
     perform the operations on the entire dataset, or they can choose to only use
     one field (and repeat this operation if they want to have multple fields).
        The module also offers a Refresh option, which simply sends a list of the
     field names to the interpreter so that the user can see which fields they can
     use should they limit the output.
